help input
 <strong>input</strong>  Prompt for user input. 
    RESULT = <strong>input</strong>(PROMPT) displays the PROMPT string on the screen, waits
    for input from the keyboard, evaluates any expressions in the input,
    and returns the value in RESULT. To evaluate expressions, <strong>input</strong> accesses
    variables in the current workspace. If you press the return key without
    entering anything, <strong>input</strong> returns an empty matrix.
 
    STR = <strong>input</strong>(PROMPT,'s') returns the entered text as a MATLAB string,
    without evaluating expressions.
 
    To create a prompt that spans several lines, use '\n' to indicate each
    new line. To include a backslash ('\') in the prompt, use '\\'.
 
    Example:
 
       reply = input('Do you want more? Y/N [Y]:','s');
       if isempty(reply)
          reply = 'Y';
       end
